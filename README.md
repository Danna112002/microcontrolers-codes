> Microcontroller I was operating on: C8051F060 by SiliconLabs.\
> There are two codes that are programming a behavoiur of the 5 LED 7-segmented displays.\
> The code 'static_text.c' enables all of the 5 displays to display a static text '80C51' at the same time. This was a challenge, bacaule the microcontoller enables to control one display at the time. \
> The 'Floating_text.c' code operates on longer text and makes this text "float" - meaning there is a part of this text shown on 5 displays and this window is moved with some delay.\
>  The third file is a header file for this particular microcontroller. It contains defininitions, declarations and  directives neccessary to enable to programme some desirable behaviours of the device.
